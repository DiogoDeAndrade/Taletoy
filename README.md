# TALETOY

Developed for the November [Game Creators Club](https://game-creators-club.itch.io/) at Lusofona University, with theme "What If".

This is a toy application, not exactly a game.
The concept is that this is a grid-based 'life sandbox' where each tile contains a symbolic life event ('baby', 'coin', 'weapon', 'stranger', 'job', 'accident', etc).
The player moves one tile per year. When next to an icon, they can interact with it in one of several ways - each representing a 'What If' moment. The world itself is a compressed metaphor of a whole life.

When they die (death probability grows with age), all choices are collected into a story skeleton.
This becomes the structured input for an LLM, which returns a stylized short story about 'this life'.
